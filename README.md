# Certify
### a Sails application scaffold for user authentication and user management
The goal of Certify is to provide a working scaffold for user authentication that
can be the basis of Sails applications where user authentication is a necessary component.
Instead of reimplementing user authentication every time you need it Certify aims to 
provide a working prototype for any solution that needs user authentication.

This is very alpha stage - and I have not even pushed stuff back to this after using it
for other projects yet - but I hope that it will grow and ease the pain for people just
getting into Sails and hopefully lead to people not having to read examples to get a working
prototype themselves.
